      <h3>Summery</h3>
      <p>I have an engineering background and my previous experience is in aircraft construction. I worked as a strength
        engineer on Boeing projects. While I was working, I realized that I was attracted to IT technologies and
        programming in particular, just like my heart belonged to it. I find this a very exciting activity and devote a
        lot of time to self-education in this direction. My goal is to build a career as a software engineer.</p>
